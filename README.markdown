# Useful ULS #

This is a front-end for searching the US Federal Communication
Commission's [Universal Licensing System][ULS].

Desired improvements over the FCC's web interface:

* Improved search speed, especially on geobox searches
* Export of data in a format suitable for scanner programming
* Standing queries (for new licenses/applications matching specified
  parameters)

This application is not intended to interface with any ULS services
requiring a login.
